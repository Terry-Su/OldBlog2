And you can demonstrate your code examples vividly in your blog or website by inserting an online editor example, which displays codes and the final result.  </p>\n<p>However, how an editor&#39;s style can stay the same with the style of your blog or website is a problem, and you have to rely on them deeply. Because of these limits, I&#39;m wondering if we can write our own code viewer using totally front-end technologies without any dynamic server, and the answer is amazing &quot;YES&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"showcase\">Showcase</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://terry-su.github.io/CDN/CodeViewer/index.html?defaultDataUrl=https://terry-su.github.io/CDN/CodeViewer/examples/hello.js\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>There&#39;re 3 HTML layers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\"> __________\n/_________/ User HTML\n\n __________\n/_________/ CodeViewer HTML\n\n __________\n/_________/ Basic HTML</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic HTML: most basic HTML that receives the data, HTML/CSS/JS strings, for rendering standalone web page from parent HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeViewer HTML: building the user interfaces to update basic HTML, and receiving settings from parent HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>User HTML: yeah, it applies some settings, such as default data or default display mode, on CodeViewer HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-s-built\">How it&#39;s built</h2>\n<p>Based on concepts above, you can already build a <a href=\"https://terry-su.github.io/CDN/CodeViewer/basicVersion/index.html\">simplified CodeViewer HTML</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Terry-Su/CDN/tree/master/CodeViewer/basicVersion\">source codes</a> are so simple that it doesn&#39;t even need Webpack at all.   </p>\n<p>However, to organize the interaction logic of CodeViewer better, using React and Redux is a good idea. CodeViewer is now using Typescript + React + <a href=\"https://github.com/dvajs/dva\">Dva</a>(a light framework including redux) as development environment.     </p>\n<p>And CodeViewer is deployed simply on a commonly used static server: <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github(Github Pages)</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-and-how-to-use-it\">Where and how to use it</h2>\n<p>In fact, you can use it anywhere only if there supports iframe. Specifically, <code>github.io</code> Github pages support iframe, like <a href=\"https://drawjs.github.io\">the official website of a canvas library</a> I wrote before.   </p>\n<p>To bind content with editor, you add content url as a parameter immediately after the CodeViewer url:   &quot;Codeviewer url + <code>?defaultDataUrl=</code> + Content url&quot;</p>\n<p>Then, just insert <code>&lt;iframe src=&quot;your-code-viewer-url&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code> into your blog or website page.  </p>\n<p>Similarly, you can also configure default display mode.
