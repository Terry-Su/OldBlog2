<p>Margin collapsing, only for <strong>top</strong> and <strong>bottom</strong> margins, is a behavior that margins of <strong>blocks</strong> are collapsed(combined).
Normally, collapsed margin&#39;s size is the largest of margins being collapsed.
There&#39;re three cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adjacent sibling</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Parent and first/last child</li>
</ol>
<iframe src="https://terry-su.github.io/BlogCDN/iframes/css/margin-collapsing/parent-and-first-child/index.html?mode=css" ></iframe>


<ol start="3">
<li>Empty blocks</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="why-margin-collpasing-">Why margin collpasing?</h1>
<p>But why does CSS have such a strange behavior?  </p>
<p>MDN says only that margins would be shared between boxes when margin collaspsing occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> When margin collapsing occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why should margins be shared? So I keep searching, and find a resonable explanation. </p>
<p>Suppose that you had several paragraph(<code>&lt;p/&gt;</code>) to set vertical margins.</p>
<p>If margins didn&#39;t collapse, they worked like padding(only for positioning part), right? So, here you used padding to mock margin.   </p>
<p>If you set both <code>padding-top:10px;</code> and <code>padding-bottom:10px;</code> to paragraphs, you would find a problem: most gaps were <code>20px</code>, but the most top gap and the most bottom were <code>10px</code>.</p>

<p>What would happen if margins collapse? It turned out all gaps were <code>10px</code>.</p>

<p>From example above, margin collpasing does solve some common vertical margin problems and this can be the reason why margin collpases.</p>
