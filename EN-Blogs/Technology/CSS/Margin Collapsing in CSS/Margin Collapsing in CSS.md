# What is margin collapsing?
Margin collapsing, only for **top** and **bottom** margins, is a behavior that margins of **blocks** are collapsed(combined).
Normally, collapsed margin's size is the largest of margins being collapsed.
There're three cases:
1. Adjacent sibling

2. Parent and first/last child

3. Empty blocks

# Why margin collpasing?
But why does CSS have such a strange behavior?  

MDN says only that margins would be shared between boxes when margin collaspsing occurs:

>  When margin collapsing occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.

But why should margins be shared? So I keep searching, and find a resonable explanation. 

Suppose that you had several paragraph(`<p/>`) to set vertical margins.

If margins didn't collapse, they worked like padding(only for positioning part), right? So, here you used padding to mock margin.   

If you set both `padding-top:10px;` and `padding-bottom:10px;` to paragraphs, you would find a problem: most gaps were `20px`, but the most top gap and the most bottom were `10px`.

What would happen if margins collapse? It turned out all gaps were `10px`.

From example above, margin collpasing does solve some common vertical margin problems and this can be the reason why margin collpases.
