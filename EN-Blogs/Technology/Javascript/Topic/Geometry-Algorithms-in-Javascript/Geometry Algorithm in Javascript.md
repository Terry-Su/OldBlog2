Recently, I've been learning geo algorithms for developing a geometry library. However, I found that the materials of 2d geometry algorithms on the internet ara **complicated** and **messy** since I only want to find several basic and commonly used algorithms. Here, I will try my best to make 2d geometry algorithms below **easy** to be understood and used. 

By the way, you may not be necessary to read this article paragraph by paragraph, you can just read any topic which you prefer. Here we go!

### Transformation
##### Translation
![Image](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/images/translation.jpg)  
Suppose we move point's position from `(x, y)` to `(x', y')`:
```math
x ' = x + t _ x
```
```math
y ' = y + t _ y
```

##### Scale  
![Image](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/images/before_scaling.jpg)  
![Image](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/images/after_scaling.jpg)  
Suppose we scale the `x` of point by `sx` times and the `y` of point by `sy` times, then:
```math
x ' = s _ x * x
```
```math
y ' = s _ y * y
```
> **Scale point based on a center point `(xc, yc)`**
> ```math
> x ' = s _ x * x - ( s _ x * x _ c - x _ c )
> ```
> ```math
> y ' = s _ y * y - ( s _ y * y _ c - y _ c )
> ```

##### Rotation
![Image](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/images/rotation.jpg)  
Suppose we rotate `OP` to `OP'`.  
Because:
```math
x = r \cdot cos \varphi
```
```math
y = r \cdot sin \varphi
```
Then:
```math
x' = r \cdot cos ( \varphi + \theta ) = r \cdot ( cos \varphi \cdot cos \theta - sin \varphi \cdot sin \theta ) = x \cdot cos \theta - y \cdot sin \theta
```
```math
y' = r \cdot sin ( \varphi + \theta ) = r \cdot ( sin \varphi \cdot cos \theta + cos \varphi \cdot sin \theta ) = x \cdot sin \theta + y \cdot cos \theta
```
> **Rotate point based on a center point `(xc, yc)`**
> ```math
> x' =  x \cdot cos \theta - y \cdot sin \theta + xc
> ```
> ```math
> y' = x \cdot sin \theta + y \cdot cos \theta + yc
> ```



### Point in polygon
In fact, there're two well-known "point in polygon" algorithms: **winding number** and **crossing number**, however, I will only talk about **winding number**, here are reasons:

/ | Rule | Suitable Scene
---|---|---
**Winding** number | [Nonezero-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule) | All polygons
Crossing Number | [Even-odd rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule) |  Polygons with simple curves

As we can see above, **crossing number** is not suitable for all polygons.

##### Winding number
![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Winding_Number_Around_Point.svg)  
Draw an **infinite ray** from `P` crossing polygon, then count each **vertex**, here's the key: suppose we start at any point on polygon path and end at the same point to draw polygon **counterclockwise**, if the `vector` intersected the **special vertex**(intersected by infinite ray and polygon) is **upward**, `wn` **adds `1`**, otherwise if the track intersected vertex is **downward**, `wn` **subtracts `1`**. If the `wn` of `P` is not `0`, then `P` is **inside** of polygon, otherwise `P` is **outside**.  
Main javascript(typescript) **codes**(If you want to see whole detail code, visit [here](https://github.com/Terry-Su/Geometry-Algorithm/blob/master/src/core/calcPointInPolygon.ts)):
```ts
/**
 * Check if point P is inside of polygon with winding number algorithm
 * Algorithm: http://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html
 * @param {Point2D} P point P
 * @param {Point2D[]} polygonVertices vertices of polygon path in clockwise or counterclockwise order
 */
function pointInPolygonWindingNumber(
  P: Point2D,
  polygonVertices: Point2D[]
) {
  /**
   * Winding nunebr
   */
  let wn = 0

  const points: Point2D[] = polygonVertices

  for ( let i: number = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++ ) {
    const V0: Point2D = points[ i ]
    const V1: Point2D = points[ i + 1 ]

    const { x: x0, y: y0 }: Point2D = V0
    const { x: x1, y: y1 }: Point2D = V1
    const { x: xp, y: yp }: Point2D = P

    /**
     * Upward
     */
    if ( y0 <= yp && y1 > yp && isLeft( V0, V1, P ) ) {
      wn = wn + 1
    }
    /**
     * Downward
     */
    if ( y0 > yp && y1 <= yp && isRight( V0, V1, P ) ) {
      wn = wn - 1
    }
  }

  const pointOnPolygonPath: boolean = isPointOnPolygonPath( P, points )
  const res: boolean = pointOnPolygonPath || wn !== 0

  return res
}
```


### Matrix
I'm curious about matrices too, not only when learning geometry algorithms. Matrix, which like an magician, transforms geometry with its particular formula.
##### Translation
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
   x' \\
   y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
   x \\
   y
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
   tx \\
   ty
\end{bmatrix}
```

##### Scale
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
   x' \\
   y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
   S _ x & 0 \\
   0 & S _ y
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
   x \\
   y
\end{bmatrix}
```

##### Rotation
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
   x' \\
   y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  cos \theta & -sin \theta \\
  sin \theta & cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
   x \\
   y
\end{bmatrix}
```


### Formulas
There are plenty of geometry algorithms, however, I only list several alogorithms which are **frequently used** above. Maybe, I say maybe, I will add new algorithms in this blog if I find new commonly used algorithm in the future. 
Nevertheless, I'll still list some **practical** formulas which can be used for geometry calculation.
##### The Cosine Law
Suppose there are vector v and w
```math
| v \pm w | ^ 2 = | v | ^ 2 \pm 2 | v | | w | cos( \theta ) + | w | ^ 2
```

##### The Dot Product
One vector multiply the other vector:
```math
v \cdot w = | v | | w | cos ( \theta )
```

##### The 2D Perp Product
```math
v \perp w = | v | | w | sin ( \theta )
```


##### Computing area
* Parallelogram
```math
A ( \Box ) = | v \perp w | 
```
```math
    = |v| |w| sin( \theta )
```

* Triangles
```math
A ( \vartriangle ) = | v \perp w | / 2t
```
```math
    = |v| |w| sin( \theta ) / 2
```



##### Lines formula
* Type-Parametric
```math
P(t) = P _ 0 + t v _ L 
```

* Line equations
```math
P ( t ) = P _ 0 + t v _ L 
```
```math
    = P _ 0 + t ( P _ 1 - P _ 0 )
```
```math
    = ( 1 - t ) P _ 0 + t P _ 1
```
```math
    = ( x _ 0 + t cos \theta , y _ 0 + t sin \theta ) 
```

It's easy to learn and use a geometry library, however, it's **limited** when we want to build a **large** or complex even just **a little complex project**. Grasping geometry algorithms will make it possible for us to create **flexible** and **large** geometry projects.
