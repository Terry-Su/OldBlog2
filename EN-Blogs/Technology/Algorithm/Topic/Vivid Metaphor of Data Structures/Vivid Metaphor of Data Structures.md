Data structures are abstract, sometimes hard to be understood. However, vivid metaphor helps us to master them better.  

Data strcutres included in this article:
* stack
* queue
* linked list


## Stack
First, let's see stack's core features:
* `push( item )`: push an item at end
* `pop()`: remove an item from end
* `peek()`: get the end element

I found a [very visual example](https://jshilpa.com/stacks-in-a-nutshell-learning-through-examples/) before, that's an open chips box.   

And to corresponse with our development habbit(count index from left to right), I push it down.

* we push a chip into box: `push( chip )`
* we take a chip from box: `pop()`
* current top chip in box: `peek()`






## Queue
Queue is similiar to stack, but easiler to learn.   

Queue's key features are:
* `enqueue( item )`: push an item at end 
* `dequeue()`: remove an item from front
* `peekFront()`: get the front item
* `peekEnd()`: get the end item


Suppose there're some people queuing to use ATM.

* at end comes a new guy: `enqueue( person )`
* front guy has done and leave: `dequeue()`
* current front guy: `peekFront()`
* current last guy: `peekEnd()`






## Linked List
Linked list consists of nodes, and each node can have a link to another link, like a chain.

Mock its main concept via codes:
```js
const nodeC = { link: null }
const nodeB = { link: nodeC }
const nodeA = { link: nodeB }

const linkedList = { head: nodeA }
```
